about: "Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O. It is the third-most common element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. When alone, two oxygen atoms usually bind to make dioxygen (O2), a colourless gas. It has no taste or smell. It is a pale blue as a liquid and solid. Dioxygen gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen is part of the chalcogen group on the periodic table, and its atomic number is 8. It is a very reactive nonmetal. It also makes oxides with many elements. Oxides make up nearly half of the Earth's crust."
